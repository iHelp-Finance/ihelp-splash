howitworks.paragraph1,The iHelp protocol serves the intersection of DeFi and charitable giving. iHelp is a decentralized non-custodial donation protocol where anyone (“Helpers”) can participate and easily contribute to charitable causes worldwide in novel ways.
howitworks.paragraph2,iHelp’s core initial donation mechanism is a no principal loss implementation that allows Helpers to donate the interest generated by their capital. Helpers are also able to directly contribute principal to a charitable cause via a direct donation.

charities.line1, iHelp makes it easy for you to fundraise from crypto donors. The protocol is great for donors and easy to use for charities:
charities.bullet1,A donor chooses which charity they want to donate to.
charities.bullet2,"Donors easily deposit a portion of their crypto savings into the protocol. They can choose to either donate the interest their assets generate, or to donate directly to your charity."
charities.bullet3,iHelp does the rest of the work.
charities.bullet4, The donor experiences the rewards of philanthropy without giving away any of their savings.
charities.q1,Does my charity need to be knowledgeable about crypto?
charities.q1a,"Charities don’t need to know anything about crypto to participate. The protocol handles everything (for real!), you’ll receive your donations in a registered brokerage account and can opt to have all donations automatically converted to USD. The iHelp protocol will always thrive to give charities the tools they need to showcase themselves and communicate with their community of donors. iHelp creates a borderless global community of long-term donors supporting your organization."

faq.q1,What is iHelp?
faq.q1a1,"The iHelp protocol is a platform for people anywhere in the world to donate interest generated in blue chip lending protocols, such as Compound & Aave, to specific charitable causes without incurring principal loss. We seek to enable anyone willing to donate the time value of a specific amount of capital to participate sustainably in philanthropy towards meaningful causes. Donors (""Helpers"") can browse a list of charities from around the world and choose the causes they wish to deposit their capital towards. The interest generated by this deposited capital will be donated to the charities. Helpers can withdraw or reallocate their capital at any time."
faq.q1a2,"The protocol will also allow users to donate principal directly to charities. We prefer capital to accumulate and donate accrued interest as this is a long-term sustainable win-win for both capital contributors (“Helpers”) and charitable organizations. However, in certain circumstances and emergencies, it may be most appropriate to also contribute principal directly to charities. For more information,"
faq.q1a3,please visit our docs
faq.q2,What is the HELP token?
faq.q2a1,"Helpers that deposit capital into charitable interest pools will receive HELP reward tokens as their capital generates interest for charities. While contributing to a cause is a noble and meaningful reward by itself, we seek to create a robust and sustainable ecosystem with specific key incentives and programmed allocation of resources that will be needed to disrupt the legacy philanthropy space. The HELP token's purpose will be to create reward mechanisms that incentivize people to use the protocol and contribute to its long-term sustainability. For more detailed information, go to the"

faq.q3,Is iHelp audited?
faq.q3a1,We are in the process of getting audited. You can find our reports in the
faq.q3a2,Security & Audit section of our docs
faq.q4,Can I get a tax receipt for my donation?
faq.q4a1,"Yes, when donating directly please opt in for “Get Tax Receipt” and follow the prompts. If you’re donating interest, please go to your Dashboard in the iHelp app, select “Tax Receipt” and follow the prompts."
faq.q5,What’s the difference between direct donation and interest donation?
faq.q5a1,"Direct donation is the traditional donation method. A Helper can select a charity and donate any amount of capital they would like to that organization. Interest donation is iHelp’s core donation mechanism. A Helper will deposit capital towards a charitable organization, iHelp will pool that capital and lend it out on blue-chip DeFi lending protocols. 80% of the interest generated by that capital will be donated towards the charitable organization the helper selected, with the remaining balance going towards staking pool rewards and iHelp’s treasury."
