    "q1": "What is IHELP?",
    "q1a1": "The IHELP protocol is a platform where people can easily generate and donate yield to charities worldwide. We seek to allow everyone the opportunity to support meaningful causes sustainably. Donors (\"Helpers\") can browse a list of charities worldwide and choose the causes they wish to support. We offer donors the opportunity to either donate yield or capital towards their chosen charities. Helpers who decide to donate yield can withdraw or reallocate their capital at any time. For more information,",
    "q1a2": "please visit our docs",
    "q2": "What is the HELP token?",
    "q2a1": "Anyone that donates yield to charities via the IHELP protocol will receive HELP reward tokens. While contributing to a cause is a noble and meaningful reward by itself, we seek to create a robust and sustainable ecosystem with specific key incentives and programmed allocation of resources that will help the protocol become a thriving ecosystem with a global donor community. In order to achieve the aforementioned goals, 13 million HELP tokens (49.8% of total supply) will be distributed via rewards to yield donors. For more information,",
    "q2a2": "HELP token section of our docs",
    "q3": "Is IHELP audited?",
    "q3a1": "We are in the process of completing our audits. You can find our reports in the",
    "q3a2": "Security & Audit section of our docs",
    "q4": "Can I get a tax deduction for my donation?",
    "q4a1": "Donors will have the option to receive a tax deduction for their donation. However, it is important to note that the tax deduction amount will be net of staking and protocol development fees, for more information",
    "q4a2": "please visit our docs",
    "q5": "What\u2019s the difference between direct donation and yield donation?",
    "q5a1": "Direct donation is the traditional donation method. A Helper can select a charity and donate any amount of capital they would like to that organization. Yield donation is IHELP's core donation system. A Helper deposits capital towards a charitable organization, IHELP pools that capital and lends it out on lending protocols. 80% of the yield generated by that capital gets donated towards the charitable organization the Helper selected, with the remaining balance going towards staking pool rewards and IHELP's treasury. The Helper can withdraw or reallocate their capital at any time. "
